A new rebuildingplan was adopted in 2015 (but not implemented until 2016) with a target rebuild date of 2018 (3-year plan).

As a result, there were unreliable indicators torecommend overfishing status so the overfishing status is now unknown. There are no reliable numerical estimates of stock size, butthe conclusion that the stock is at historically low levels and other indicators support maintaining the stock as overfished.
